        <h2>The PIR Report</h2>
        <p>
          We have already explored why the purpose of a PIR is to learn as much as we can about how an incident unfolded in a relatively short period of time.
          We <b>share</b> these learnings by documenting a <b>PIR report</b>. The best way to prepare for a PIR is to <b>draft an initial version</b> of the PIR report.
          A PIR report is usually pieced together in a collaborative document or wiki page and has four essential ingredients, as shown in Table 1.

              <td>Responders may join an ongoing incident at separate stages, and leave with different perspectives on what has unfolded. Assembling an incident timeline establishes a common understanding of the flow of events. It is vital to determine the boundaries of the incident before we can learn from it.</td>

It is essential to agree on any fixes or improvements that need to be made to the system. All action items should have a named owner who will be make sure that they are completed.</td>

          While the discussion topics, learning points, and action items will come into focus during the PIR meeting itself, as PIR leader you should <b>assemble the incident timeline in advance</b> of the PIR meeting.

              Key Point: We share the knowledge gained from an incident by compiling a PIR report. The incident timeline, a core ingredient of the PIR report, must be written <u>before</u> the PIR meeting takes place.
