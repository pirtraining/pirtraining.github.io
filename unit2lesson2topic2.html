        <h2>During the PIR Meeting</h2>
        <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
          <li><p>Start the PIR meeting by <b>welcoming participants</b> and outlining the agenda.
            <br>Example agenda: <i>“Hello to everyone joining this Post Incident Review meeting to learn from the events of [insert date].
            <br>I will begin the meeting by talking us through the incident timeline.
            <br>The second part of the meeting will focus on identifying shared learnings and action items.”
            </i>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Make it clear that the meeting is a <b>safe space</b> and the group are here to learn about how the system has surprised us.
            <br>Example introduction: <i>“You have been invited to this meeting because you have gained expertise in an area of complexity.
            <br>The purpose of this meeting is to share this knowledge with those who didn’t have this experience.
            <br>Over the course of this discussion we will also look for actions to help us to reduce future risk.”</i>
            </p>
          </li>
            <li>Begin the PIR meeting by <b>reading through the timeline</b>.

                  Tip: Allow clarifications from the group, but strongly encourage participants to <b>hold questions</b> until the discussion portion of the meeting. It's easy for this part of the meeting to get derailed by getting off-topic.

            </div>
          </li>
          <li><p>Once the group are agreed on the incident timeline, <b>transition to the discussion</b> phase of the meeting.
            <br>Example transition: <i>“Now that we all agree on the sequence of events, let's unpack how it happened.
            <br>I encourage all attendees to actively participate in this part of the discussion, listen carefully, ask questions, and share your thoughts and ideas.
            <br>My role in this part of the meeting is to moderate a respectful dialogue and to highlight key learnings and action items.
            <br>Would anyone like to propose any topics or questions?”

                  Tip: Consider asking someone to be a <b>dedicated note-taker</b> to capture what is said during the PIR meeting. This will free you up to focus on guiding the discussion and asking questions.

          <li>Be prepared to <b>keep this part of the meeting on track</b> in three ways:
            <ol type="i" style="padding-left: 30px;">
              <li>Monitoring the time, making sure the group do not spend too much time on one topic;</li>
              <li>Highlighting a shared learning or action item that will be surfaced in the PIR report.</li>
              <li>Asking open-ended questions.</li>
            </ol>

                  Tip: Engineers tend to focus on engineering details. Listen out for human experiences and let those inform your questions:
                  Were roles and responsibilities clear?
                  Were tempers frayed?
                  Was information flowing?
                  Was it clear when people were no longer needed to assist?
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li><p>Close out the meeting on a positive note by thanking participants for their time and advising on next steps.
            <br>Example close: <i>“Thank you all for your thoughtful input today.
            <br>I will write a PIR report summarising our learnings and action items.
            <br>I will circulate a draft PIR report to the participants of this meeting and invite corrections.
            <br>I will then make the final version of the PIR report available to the wider organisation so that others may benefit from your expertise. Thanks for sharing!”
