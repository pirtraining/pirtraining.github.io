        <h2>The Language of Explanation</h2>
        <p>
          In the previous lesson we hinted at RCA approaches that ask <b>“why”</b> questions.
          This technique is best known as the <b>Five Whys</b>.
          <i>Listen/Read more about the Five Whys here TBD</i>.
          Consider the following example of the Five Whys in action from https://hbr.org/2010/04/the-five-whys-for-startups (see Example 2.1).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b style="color:#575757">Example 2.1 Five whys:</b>
        </p>

            <i>TBD - Better Visual!</i>
            <br>..A new release broke a key feature for customers. Why? Because a particular server failed.
            <br>....Why did the server fail? Because an obscure subsystem was used in the wrong way.
            <br>......Why was it used in the wrong way? The engineer who used it didn’t know how to use it properly.
            <br>........Why didn’t he know? Because he was never trained.
            <br>..........Why wasn’t he trained? Because his manager doesn’t believe in training new engineers, because they are “too busy.”
          </p>

        <p>
          Example 2.1 illustrates the <b>narrowing</b> effect of asking “why”. 
          The first “why” could just as easily have started with a different event, leading the team to come up with five <b>completely different</b> and <b>equally valid</b> “whys”. 
          Forcing the team down a <b>single causal pathway</b> narrows the the scope of what can be learned from the incident.
          If you recall Heinrich’s “five domino model” of accident causation from the previous lesson, then Example 2.1's first domino is simply a lack of training. 
          Following this path would result in training being the <b>sole target for improvement efforts</b>.
          Example 2.1 also illustrates another significant effect of asking “why”—it prompts people to <b>justify their actions</b> and <b>defend their decisions</b>.
          This is <b>the language of explanation</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a natural human instinct to want to <b>explain</b> <i>why</i> an action occurred, and <i>who</i> is responsible for that action.
          In linguistic terms, this assignment of action is called <b>agency</b> (Vesel 2020, p.34).
          An <b>agent</b> of an action is the <b>“doer”</b> of that action. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b style="color:#575757">Example 2.2 Agentive language:</b>
        </p>
        <div class="text-container" style="background-color: #DDDDDD; margin-top: 5px;"> 
          <div class="text-item">
            <p>
              “Sam made an error”
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The statement in Example 2.2 clearly identifies Sam as the <b>agent</b>. 
          However, Example 2.2 does not consider whether Sam had incorrect instructions, was under extreme stress, or many other possible conditions. 
          What it achieves is to imply that <b>Sam is the kind of person that makes errors</b>. 
          <i>TBD Listen/Read more about “fundamental attribution error” (Ross 1977, p.187)</i> 
          We, as readers of that statement, might think to ourselves, “I would never do that.” 
          It would be completely normal to do so. 
          However, by making a <b>judgement</b> on Sam’s character, we create a <b>separation</b> between ourselves and Sam. 
          And as a result of that separation, it becomes easier to <b>blame</b> Sam. Assigning blame has <b>consequences</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Blame <b>creates</b> fear.
          <br>
          Blame <b>erodes</b> trust.
          <br>
          Blame <b>destroys</b> team psychological safety.
          <br>
          Blame <b>scares away</b> learning.
